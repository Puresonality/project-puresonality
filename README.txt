***GITHUB NOTICE***

Welcome to Project Puresonality!
Currently I have a website in progress to host all this info in a more accessible fashion.
Meanwhile, this project contains all the content that I have written and is open to the community,
for learning and/or content submissions. 

If you are here to learn about Cognitive Functions,
start in the in Site Intro section,
which will explain what this is and what you should read first.
Understand, this is a perpetual rough draft project,
and as such is not a finished project,
but I do hope you find it a valuable resource.

If you wish to submit content or revisions,
feel free to do so. If you are using git,
please do submissions for each file independently.
If you don't know how to use git,
feel free to email any of your submissions to
Puresonality@gmail.com, alongside a name you wish to be known by,
and I can review them there.

All submissions can be accepted or rejected for any reason whatsoever,
and you accept that the information submitted is now part of the project,
subject to the project license and copyright, and is no longer your property.
Please read the license and copyright before submitting.
Please also add your name to the project_info/data/Contributors.txt if you are going to contribute.

You may not use this project for any commercial purposes without my permission.
You may not share this project after you have modified it outside of github without my permission.
You are free to share the project with anybody, insofar as you include a complete copy of the project when sharing it.
You are encouraged to do that.
This is to ensure that this project remains the central point of revision, and that it is not rehosted elsewhere.

Thank you!
